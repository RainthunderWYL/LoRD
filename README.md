# LoRD

## Introduction

LoRD, short for Locate Reconnection Distribution, is a toolkit designed to analyzing the localized structures of 3D magnetic reconnection.

LoRD includes ASL (Analyze Singular Lines), ANP (Analyze Null Points), and APNP (Analyze Projected Null Points) functions.

ASL is the main function of LoRD, which locates the grids undergoing singular line reconnection as proposed by Priest et al. 1989.

ANP locates and classifies the 3D null points based on the theory by Parnel et al. 1996.

APNP analyzes the 2D neutral points locally projected on the Maximal Shear Plane defined by users.

LoRD is implemented in both matlab and C languages.
